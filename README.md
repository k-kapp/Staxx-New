# Staxx-New
New Staxx Code base for visual studio

This is a little game that I wrote in C++ that plays like a tetris game, but in four directions. On each of the sides of the playing area, the player must fill up the lines that make up that direction, as in normal Tetris. When a line is filled, it also disappears and the lines "above" it move "down", but since we are working in four directions, the new line is inserted in the middle of the screen, not at the "top" ("top", "down" and "above" depending on the side of the screen we are referring to here).
